Samples
=======

[Showcase](Showcase.html)
-------------------------

Translation of [Showcase demo](http://gwt.google.com/samples/Showcase/Showcase.html) originally written in Java.
This sample shows how to use various GWT widgets and other features. We managed to translate 99% (around 4k SLoC)
of the source code to Scala.

**NOTE**: Our translation is based on outdated version of Showcase demo so it looks a bit differently than original
one.

[Sudoku solver](GwtDlx.html)
----------------------------

We took [scala-gwt-dlx](http://code.google.com/p/scala-gwt-dlx/) project and decided to try run everything in a browser
as opposed to original [client-server application](http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1826). By suceeding in doing that
we have shown that you can move non-trivial code between server and browser.

[Phone book mnemonics](Mnemonics.html)
--------------------------------------

This sample shows that Scala+GWT supports full power of Scala collections in a browser. We took example from
[OSCON 2011 presentation](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/17884) by Martin Odersky and compiled
straight to JS without any special gymnastics. We find idea of having Scala collections compiled to JS really thrilling!
